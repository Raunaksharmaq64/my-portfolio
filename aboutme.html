                Hi, I'm Raunak Sharma, a passionate and driven student who has recently 
                completed my intermediate education and is now embarking on an exciting
                journey in Computer Science Engineering. 
                With a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, and currently diving deep 
                into the world of JavaScript, <span id="text-mdl"> am committed
                to building modern, user-friendly, and dynamic web experiences.</span>
                What sets me apart is my unwavering dedication and hunger to learn.
                I believe that technology is not just a field—it's a canvas 
                where imagination meets innovation.
                Every line of code I write is a step toward mastering the 
                craft of web development.

                I'm not just learning—I’m evolving. Whether it’s experimenting with new tools,
                solving coding challenges, or exploring design principles,
                I strive to grow each day as a developer and as a thinker.

                As I step into my B.Tech journey, I aim to transform ideas into impactful 
                digital solutions and contribute meaningfully to the tech world.
                Let’s build something amazing together.

                🔹 I see every project as an opportunity to learn, grow, and push the boundaries of what I can create.

                🔹 My journey in tech began with curiosity—and that curiosity has turned into a deep passion for building and designing on the web.

                🔹 I may be at the beginning of my career, but my vision is clear: to become a skilled developer who creates clean, meaningful, and scalable digital solutions.

                🔹 I believe in the power of code to not just solve problems, but to tell stories, enhance experiences, and bring ideas to life.

                🔹 My focus right now is sharpening my frontend skills, but I'm equally excited to explore backend development and become a full-stack web wizard in the 
                   future.

                🔹 With every click and every line of code, I'm learning how to turn imagination into interaction.

                🔹 I thrive in environments that challenge me and give me a reason to dig deeper, think harder, and create smarter.

                🔹 I may be a student today, but I’m building the mindset and skills of tomorrow’s tech innovator.
                
                🔹 I believe that learning never stops — and for me, every bug is just another lesson in disguise.
                
                🔹 Technology isn’t just my career path; it’s my passion, my playground, and my purpose.

                🔹 From static web pages to interactive applications, I’m on a mission to bring ideas to life through code.

                🔹 As I dive deeper into the world of JavaScript, I’m discovering the art behind logic and the logic behind art.

                🔹 I approach every challenge with curiosity, every error with patience, and every solution with pride.


                🔹 I aim not only to build websites, but to craft digital experiences that are smooth, accessible, and engaging.

                🔹 Whether it’s a small project or a complex application, I give it my full energy and attention.

                🔹 I’m not just building a future in tech — I’m building myself with every step, every skill, every line of code.

                🔹 My ultimate goal? To turn creativity into code, and passion into profession.

                🔹 I don’t just want to be a developer. I want to be a problem-solver, innovator, and lifelong learner.

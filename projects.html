            <h1 class="amazon text">📝 Project Description:</h1> 
            <br>
            Amazon Clone (Front-End Only)

            This project is a front-end replica of Amazon's homepage using only HTML and CSS.
            It focuses on structuring and styling key UI components to closely resemble the 
            original design of Amazon India’s website. The goal was to practice and demonstrate skills 
            in layout design, flexbox, image handling, and responsive styling principles.

           Includes a logo, delivery address section, and placeholders for account/cart info.
           Built using Flexbox for proper alignment and spacing.
           Font Awesome icons (like the location pin) are integrated.


            <h1 class="amazon text">Hero Section (.hero_section):</h1> 

            Large promotional banner area with a centered call-to-action message.
            Uses a background image to mimic Amazon’s main carousel area.

            <h1 class="amazon text">Search Bar (.nav-search):</h1> 


            Functional layout of a search box with a category dropdown and search icon.
            Responsive width with hover effects.

            Displays quick access links such as "All" and "Today's Deals".
            Styled with text alignment and bold white text on a dark background.

            <h1 class="amazon text">Product Boxes (.shop-section):</h1>

            CSS3 (including Flexbox)

            <h1 class="amazon text">📱 Responsive Design:</h1>

            The <meta name="viewport"> tag is used to ensure proper scaling on mobile devices. 
            Some elements are relatively positioned for alignment, though full responsiveness can be 
            improved in future versions.
